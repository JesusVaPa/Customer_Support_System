Objective:
In this project I will develop a server side application to respond customers' tickets using AI. This
application will receive the tickets and automatically understand the intent, then, based on 
response database, will answer the customer.


Basic features to build the app:
    1. Build an authentication system
    2. Design Ticket form on user side and save to DB
    3. Design FAQ form on Admin side and create and show FAQ
    4. FAQ database include problems and solution
    5. Preprocessing the tickets recieved from users
    6. Fine tune LLM model and generate a respose based on FAQ
    7. Ask customer if this helped them or not. if they said no, we ask them to explain why and then we 
    respond again based on new data. if it didn't work, we connect them to human experts
