# Intelligent Customer Support System

## Problem Statement
Many businesses struggle to provide efficient and personalized customer support due to the huge number of inquiries. Manual handling of customer queries which can lead to delays in responses. A machine learning-powered customer support system can automate responses to common queries. In this project I am working specifically on customer reviews. However, in future updates I will add more features to this application.

## Proposed Solution
I decided to develop a Flask-based web application that serves as an intelligent customer support system. The system will integrate various machine learning models to classify and respond to customer reviews.


#### The final look of the application will be like this:
